# RUNNING THE SCRIPTS

#sample script
make sure sample names are as follows:
    Paired end analysis:
`SAMPLE_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`, `SAMPLE_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz`, etc.


STAR SOLO has the ability to account for multiple sample lanes e.g (L001,L002...L00n)
It will merge the multiple lanes
e.g.
SAMPLE_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
SAMPLE_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz
SAMPLE_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz

They will be passed to STAR via comma-separated lists using `--readFilesIn` without needing concatenation.

No need to change`sample_list.txt` format — just use base sample ID
e.g. SAMPLE



#paths script

#make sure you include the absolute paths for the following:

FASTA (directory to reference genome fasta file)
GTF (directory to reference genome GTF file)
DATA DIR (directory to FastQC/ cleaned samples)
OUT DIR (directory to where you would like the output to end up)



##### OPTIONAL STEP#####

You may estimate --sjdbOverhang
# note that to estimate the overhang of paired reads, use the R2 file of your sample. 
#R2 stores the sequences and R1 stores the barcodes 

 run the following code:
bash
./pipe_scripts/check_read_length.sh data/SAMPLE_R2_001.fastq.gz


#run the alignment pipeline 

bash run_scRNA_pipeline.sh -c config/paths.config -s config/sample_list.txt


#output files

#barcode
#matrix
